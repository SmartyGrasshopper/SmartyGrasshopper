I like to refer myself as **Gras** (codename on github).
I like to observe the world around me
and process the information received.
During the process,
I often discover problems
that I would like to solve
or solve in a better way (if already solved by someone else).

Writing software is one of the main ways
that I use to solve these problems.
I am willing to write software that are performant
i.e. that do not consume unnecessary resources
(time, bandwidth, CPU, memory, etc.).
In my spare time,
I like to write/explore new software
that provide better resource optimization and developer-experience
building on the lessons from existing software and new innovations.
I believe in the coexistence of OSS and Proprietary software.

At the time of writing this document,
my main programming language is `Python3`.
I have explored many programming languages at shallow level
and concluded to learn and use following in future
in the given order -
1. JavaScript
2. Rust (as a new alternative to C++)

`Javascript` use is out of necessity of the web.
`Rust` is out of interest for better DX, programming safety innovations and performance.
