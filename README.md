# About Me

Hello! You can call me **Gras** (my GitHub codename).  
I enjoy observing the world, identifying problems, and finding better ways to solve them. Writing software is my primary tool for turning ideas into solutions.

## My Approach to Software Development

- I strive to write **performant software** that avoids unnecessary resource usage (e.g., time, bandwidth, CPU, memory).
- In my free time, I explore and create software that enhances resource optimization and developer experience, learning from existing tools and new innovations.
- I value the coexistence of **Open Source Software (OSS)** and proprietary software.

## My Tech Stack

- **Primary Language**: Python 3  
- **Future Learning Goals**:
  1. JavaScript (for web development necessity)
  2. Rust (for its focus on developer experience, programming safety, and performance)
