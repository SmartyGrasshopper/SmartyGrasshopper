Hi! I call myself **Grasshopper** (on software related platforms). Here are some details related to me so that you can know me better.

## General Details

- Often thinking something.
- I work upon practical philosophy (sometimes).
- Areas of academic & work interest -
  - Primary: Computers/softwares & related maths.
  - Secondary: Physics
  
  Although, I keep exploring. So sometimes interests can be outside the above two.
- Likes systematic & logical work where possible and feasible.

## Programming/Software Details

- I like to work with open-source technology and willing to contribute if I can work on the project (i.e. the contribution is possible by my present knowledge or academic interest).
- Knows **`python`** and generally use it for exploring ideas through computer aid.
- Targeting to learn web technologies (mainly `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS`) somwhere in near future.
- `C++` and `Rust` enthusiast. Knows `C++` to some extent and hope to learn `Rust` in distant future.
